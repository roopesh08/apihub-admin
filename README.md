## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run eject`

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

## 🚀 Running the Application

### Running the Frontend

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd client
    ```

2. Start the React development server:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

    This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Running the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory (if your backend is in a separate directory):

    ```sh
    cd client
    ```

2. Install backend dependencies (if you haven't already):

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the Express server:

    ```sh
    node server.js
    ```

    This will start the backend server, typically running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### Running Both Frontend and Backend Concurrently

To run both frontend and backend servers concurrently, you can use a tool like `concurrently`. First, install `concurrently`:

```sh
npm install concurrently --save-dev
```

Then, add a new script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "concurrently \"npm run start:client\" \"npm run start:server\"",
  "start:client": "cd client && npm start",
  "start:server": "cd backend && node server.js"
}
```

Now, you can start both servers with a single command:

```sh
npm start
```

## 📚 Usage

To use and develop this project, follow the installation steps and use the available scripts to start the development server or build the project for production. Customize the project by adding more features and dependencies as required.
